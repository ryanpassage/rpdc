Hi I'm Ryan.  I'm currently the manager of Information Technology for a medium-sized manufacturing company in the Toyota family. I enjoy closely following the new directions technology is taking, and discovering how it can be applied to make life simpler, more secure, and more enjoyable.

My interests tend to center on topics related to information security and software development. I feel like, with 15 years of experience either managing systems or writing code for them, I might have something to say from time to time.
