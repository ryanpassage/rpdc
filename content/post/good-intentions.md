So this is the "hello world" post for Ryan's Blog, take 5. I really do have good intentions for this thing. 

I've had a few blog post ideas in the queue for a while, but never really had a good place to put them.  I was collecting some of the bits and pieces of my digital life the other day to try and put some sort of organization to work, and came across those old ideas.  I think some of them could be pretty good, maybe even useful for someone to read someday, so motivation set in to try this out (again).

I *would like* to put myself on a schedule. I don't want to force a poorly written post or anything like that, but writing is a skill that I do think should be exercised every now and then.

I am also aware that, if anyone winds up reading this stuff, I am opening myself up for some criticism.  I'm not a world renouned expert in any of the stuff I'll be writing about, so there will inevitably be some, shall we say, *factual inaccuracies*.  Sorry in advance for that.
