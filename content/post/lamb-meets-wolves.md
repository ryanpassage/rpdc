> Thoughts on responses from [this post on /r/AskNetsec](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/8lc1lu/totally_uneducated_in_this_area_and_tasked_with/ "this post on /r/AskNetsec").

I read a post on reddit the other day that got me a little hot under the collar. The discussion was started by someone who works at a very small law firm, which had a concern about the security of their email system -- in particular the way they exchange confidential information with contacts outside their firm. The original poster was very open about being uneducated in this area and out of their league, so I thought it was an interesting topic and I decided to read the comments to follow along.

Boy was I disappointed. Maybe there was just something in the water that day in /r/AskNetsec, but some of the replies struck me as being hostile and really not at all helpful. This is especially wacky considering the purpose of the AskNetsec forum: to ask security questions!

I think this is bad business for infosec and IT in general. It's not helpful and only serves to push the image of [Nick Burns, Your Company's Computer Guy](https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/nick-burns-your-companys-computer-guy/n11268 "Nick Burns, Your Company's Computer Guy") to those who don't get a lot of exposure to actual IT support capable of empathy. There can be such a disconnect between those that need _(need)_ help outside the field and those that can provide it. 

Some of the information security influencers that I follow on social media have zeroed in on this as well.  They see the negative effects of haughtiness as a real challenge in the pursuit of advocating for better security and awareness.
