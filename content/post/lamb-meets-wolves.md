> Thoughts on responses from [this post on /r/AskNetsec](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/8lc1lu/totally_uneducated_in_this_area_and_tasked_with/ "this post on /r/AskNetsec").

I read a post on reddit the other day that had me raising an eyebrow. The discussion was started by someone who works at a very small law firm, which had a concern about the security of their email system -- in particular the way they exchange confidential information with contacts outside their firm. The original poster was very open about being uneducated in this area and I thought it was an interesting topic, so I decided to read the comments to follow along.

Boy was I disappointed. Maybe there was just something in the water that day in /r/AskNetsec, but some of the replies struck me as being hostile and really not at all helpful. This is especially bizarre considering the purpose of the AskNetsec forum: to ask and answer security questions!

Back several years ago (😵) when I was in college, I was involved in helping to run a server on the [Undernet IRC network](http://www.undernet.org "Undernet IRC network"). We had a help channel for our server, where people could come and ask questions or get us to help them untangle whatever drama their channel was going through. There were always these people that would hang out and try to help, but for whatever reason they ended up doing some harm instead. Maybe they were trying too hard or wanted to score points with us to raise their own profile on the network. Whatever the reason, it was very counterproductive.

This reddit discussion reminded me of those times back on IRC. Sure, people were volunteering, but there was this undercurrent of wanting to prove you knew it all, even if you had to step on a few “newbies” to do so. I don’t think this is all that rare in geek cultures. I do think this is bad business for infosec and IT in general. It's not helpful and only serves to push the image of [Nick Burns, Your Company's Computer Guy](https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/nick-burns-your-companys-computer-guy/n11268 "Nick Burns, Your Company's Computer Guy") to those who don't get a lot of exposure to actual IT support capable of expressing empathy. There can be such a divide between those that need _(actually need)_ help and those that can provide it.

Some of the information security influencers that I follow on social media have zeroed in on this as well.  They see the negative effects of haughtiness as a real challenge in the pursuit of advocating for better security and awareness. It just turns people off and discourages them from ever wanting to invest their time or interest in the mission at hand, which is keeping us all protected from the bad guys.

In short:

> I don't really like that my first post of any real substance is basically a criticism. It sets kind of a negative tone. But I also left the reddit post open in a separate browser tab for like 2 weeks and realized that it really must've bothered me, so I probably should say _something_.
